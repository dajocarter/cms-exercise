# Eaze Wordpress Front End Project

> Our Wordpress code challenge for engineering applicants

## Project

The purpose of this exercise is to help the Eaze Engineering team get a feel for your technical skill level. This exercise has two parts: The first being the setup of a CMS environment using the Wordpress [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) and a front-end framework of your choice (React, Vue, Angular, etc.). For the second part of the exercise we would like you to build a web page that displays some articles combined with a list of GIFs from Giphy.

## Wordpress Exercise

You’ll need to get a WordPress development environment set up on your local machine using a front-end framework of your choice (React, Vue, Angular, etc.). Once that is running, create different blog posts with the provided data. Each article will have some tags associated with it and we would like for the app to dynamically include some GIFs, that are pulled in by the Giphy API, inside the content of the blog post.

Users should have a good experience on desktop, and mobile devices.

This exercise is pretty open ended in order to leave you some freedom to improve upon the base by focusing on what you like the most.

We strongly encourage you to pick a couple of optional improvements. The following are just some ideas, so if none of these interest you, feel free to do something that isn’t on this list:

- Show off your CSS and design skills!
- Animations are awesome! Show us what you got.
- Use your UX hat to think of a creative way of injecting the GIFs.
- Think of your development environment and how it will scale.

## Project Structure

We already wrote a few articles for you so that you don’t have to generate the content.

## Evalutation

The app should run on any computer by running npm install and npm start. We’ll evaluate the exercise by looking at the end result and the code.

Provide the login route for the data entry UI view and the user login information. We should be able to login and successfully view/edit the content of each specific post.
